Here&#39;s a guide to help you resolve common payment issues quickly and efficiently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Common Payment Issues and How to Resolve Them:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Payment Declined:</strong><br />\r\nCheck Card Details: Ensure all card details entered are correct, including card number, expiration date, and CVV.<br />\r\nVerify Card Validity: Confirm that your card is still valid and has not expired.<br />\r\nContact Your Bank: Sometimes payments are declined due to bank restrictions. Contact your bank to check if they are blocking the transaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Error Messages During Payment:</strong><br />\r\nInternet Connection: Confirm you have a stable internet connection as interruptions can cause transaction failures.<br />\r\nUpdate Xpertfirst App: Make sure you&rsquo;re using the latest version of the Xpertfirst app. Outdated versions can sometimes lead to errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Double Charged:</strong><br />\r\nCheck Your Account Statements: Sometimes transactions may appear as duplicates, but only one charge is actually processed.<br />\r\nContact Customer Support: If you are indeed double charged, reach out to Xpertfirst customer support with your transaction details for assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Promo Code Not Working:</strong><br />\r\nCheck Code Validity: Ensure the promo code is valid and has not expired.<br />\r\nRead Terms and Conditions: Some codes are service-specific or have usage terms. Ensure your booking aligns with these terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Trouble Adding New Payment Method:</strong><br />\r\nRe-enter Details: Carefully re-enter your payment method details, ensuring all information is correct.<br />\r\nAlternate Payment Method: Try adding a different card or payment method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When to Contact Xpertfirst Customer Support:</strong><br />\r\nIf you&rsquo;ve tried the above steps and still face issues.<br />\r\nFor queries related to refunds, double charges, or unrecognized transactions.<br />\r\nFor assistance with applying promo codes or gift cards.</p>",
